= jqassistant-jmolecules-plugin


The jMolecules Plugin provides concepts to map architectural language elements from the jMolecules project
(https://github.com/xmolecules/jmolecules) to the graph representation build by jQAssistant
in order to gain new insights, create additional concepts and constraints.

== Usage of the jQAssistant jMolecules Plugin

Please check the documentation of the jMolecules project to see how architectural concepts can be marked in the source code.

Afterwards, to have jQAssistant consider the annotations and to allow the execution of constraints, the following plugin must be declared in th jQAssistant configuration:

[source,yml]
..jqassistant.yml
----
jqassistant:
  plugins:
    - group-id: org.jqassistant.plugin
      artifact-id: jqassistant-jmolecules-plugin
      version: 2.0.0

== Mapping between jMolecules and jQAssistant

jMolecules comes with a set of different sub-projects, each providing annotations and marker interfaces for different
architectural aspects. 

The `jqassistant-jmolecules-plugin` provides concepts to map the annotations and interfaces to the graph. For each sub-project, there is a jQAssistant rule group containing all relevant concepts and additional constraints. Following is the mapping between jMolecules and jQAssistant.

== Visual Reporting

=== PlantUML-Reporting
The jMolecules plug-in supports visualization of concepts using the `jqassistant-plantuml-report-plugin` for the following concepts:

* Bounded Context
* Module
* Ring (both for classical and simplified Onion Architecture)
* Layer (Interface, Application, Domain, Infrastructure)

To use this functionality, define the jQAssistant concept with the following property set:

* `reportType="plantuml-component-diagram"`

=== Context Mapper-Reporting

The jMolecules plug-in works well with the `jqassistant-context-mapper-plugin` to visualize Bounded Contexts identified via jMolecules as a context map.
